# Antipode Weather

A simple weather app with a twist. Instead of getting the weather for your current position, it fetches weather from the other side of the world. Check out the project at [https://antipode-weather.vercel.app/](https://antipode-weather.vercel.app/)

# Installation

1.  Clone the project
    -   ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/theo0165/useless-web
        ```
2.  Enter the project folder
    -   ```bash
        cd useless-web
        ```
3.  Open the index.html file in your browser or start a live server.

# Testing instructions

If the website does not ask for location (known bug that i can not fix). Go to site settings, press lock to the left of the site url. Then press "Site Settings", scroll down to "Location" and choose "Allow".
Refresh the website for the changes to take effect.

# Code Review

Done by [Linn√©a Eriksson](https://github.com/LinneaEriksson)
1. index.js:21-29 - You could use createElement instead of innerHTML. 
2. Overall  - Would be nice with more comments to get a greater understanding of the code. 

‚Ä®‚Ä®Since I couldn‚Äôt find anything else to improve in your code I have written three comments about what you have done good! :)‚Ä®

3. Overall - You have a very good folder structure in your project.
4. Overall - You have good names on your elements. Even though I could not open the code in my browser (due to settings), I understand what is what.
5. index.html: 29 - It‚Äôs nice that you tell the user what they can do on the website, for example ‚ÄúHover over elements for the real data‚Ä¶‚Äù.‚Ä®

Cool project, well done! üôÇ
